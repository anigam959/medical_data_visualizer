🩺 Medical Data Visualizer
📌 Project Overview

The Medical Data Visualizer is a data analysis and visualization project that explores health-related data to identify patterns and correlations. The project focuses on analyzing medical records (such as cholesterol, glucose, BMI, and lifestyle indicators) to evaluate cardiovascular risk factors and provide meaningful insights through visualizations.

This project demonstrates the use of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, processing, and visualization.

⚙️ Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning of medical dataset

Statistical analysis of health indicators (cholesterol, glucose, alcohol, smoking, activity)

Clear data visualizations (bar plots, categorical plots, heatmaps)

Correlation matrix with a heatmap for identifying relationships between health variables

Well-structured and modular Python code with testing support
